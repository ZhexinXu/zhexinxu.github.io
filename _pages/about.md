Hi there! I am a postdoctoral researcher in [the Datta Lab](http://datta.hms.harvard.edu/) in the Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School. I did my PhD in <a href="http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/">Brain and Cognitive Sciences</a> at the University of Rochester with [Greg DeAngelis](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/people/faculty/deangelis_greg/index.html), during which I studied how the primate visual system infers 3D scene structure (e.g., motion and depth) during active movements using electrophysiology, psychophysics, and computational models. Before that, I majored in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn/">Tongji Univerisity</a> in Shanghai, China. I once considered designing wood-drilling machines for a living but gave up due to mediocre drawing skills. I am now interested in solving the brain, particularly the neural circuits underlying active sensing and sensorimotor control in naturalistic behaviors. Besides science, I enjoy swimming, photography, reading, cooking, hiking, and traveling.
