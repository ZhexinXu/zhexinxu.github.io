Hi there! I'm Brian, a PhD student in <a href="http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/">Brain and Cognitive Sciences</a> at the University of Rochester. I use psychophysics, electrophysiology, and computational models to study how the visual system infers 3D scene structure (e.g., motion and depth) during active movements.


Previously, I studied Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn/">Tongji Univerisity</a> in Shanghai, China.
