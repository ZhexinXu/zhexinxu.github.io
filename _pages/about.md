Hi there! I'm Brian, a PhD student in <a href="http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/">Brain and Cognitive Sciences</a> with a joint degree in <a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/">Computer Science</a>, at University of Rochester. I use psychophysics, ephys, and computational models to study how the visual system infers 3D scene structure (e.g., motion and depth) during active movements. I am also very interested in the intersections between neuroscience and AI. 

For summer 2022, I joined [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Chief Analytics Office as a Senior Data Scientist Intern, where I build machine learning models and causal inference tools to perform impact assessment.

In the summers of 2020 and 2021, I TA'd for <a href="https://academy.neuromatch.io">Neuromatch Academy</a>, a three-week online course on <a href="https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html">Computational Neuroscience</a> and <a href="https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html">Deep Learning</a> that serves thousands of students around the world each year.

Previously, I studied Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn/">Tongji Univerisity</a> in Shanghai, China.


I will be finishing my PhD in 2023 and I'm actively exploring research opportunities in both academia and industry.
