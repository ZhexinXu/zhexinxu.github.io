Hi there! This is Brian, I am currently a PhD student in <a href="http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/">Brain and Cognitive Sciences</a> with a joint degree in <a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/">Computer Science</a>, at University of Rochester. I study the neural computations of visual motion and depth, as well as causal inference and multisensory perception. I am also very interested in the intersections between neuroscience and AI. 

In the summer of 2020 and 2021, I TA'd for <a href="https://academy.neuromatch.io">Neuromatch Academy</a>, a three-week online program on <a href="https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html">Computational Neuroscience</a> and <a href="https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html">Deep Learning</a>.

Previously, I studied Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn/">Tongji Univerisity</a> in Shanghai, China.
